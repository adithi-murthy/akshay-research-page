        Our Materials for Quantum Devices group consists of a team of graduate
        students, postdoctoral scholars, engineers, and technicians working to
        apply structural, chemical, magnetic, and electronic characterization
        techniques to identify sources of decoherence in superconducting quantum
        devices, such as superconducting resonators and superconducting qubits.
        These include techniques such as SIMS, XPS, S/TEM, AFM, PPMS, XRR/XRD,
        and various spin resonance techniques.{" "}
