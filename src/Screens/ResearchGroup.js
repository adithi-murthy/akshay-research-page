      Our group is composed of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and engineers. 
      We collaborate to improve coherence times by applying a variety of advanced materials 
      characterization tools — electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and 
      time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry — to understand the physical processes 
      that lead to the loss of quantum information, called decoherence. Using these techniques 
      as part of a materials-oriented approach, the SQMS research team has recently achieved 
      leading coherence times in transmon qubits. We aim to answer questions such as:

      <li>Are the surfaces of these materials ordered or disordered? What about the interfaces between materials?</li>
      <li>What impurities are present in our materials? Where are they located?</li>
      <li>What types of defects are present in these devices? How do they respond during device operation at cryogenic temperatures?</li>

      <h5>I am also the leader for the materials for 2D and 3D quantum devices focus area in the SQMS center, 
          which consists of over 70 researchers across 11 partner institutions focused on fabrication of quantum devices, 
          as well as characterization of quantum devices using structural, chemical, superconducting and microwave-based 
          methods. In this role I prioritize, manage and evaluate activities to ensure SQMS achieves its research goals 
          in a timely fashion. I am extremely passionate about advancing the performance of superconducting qubit 
          platforms, with my ultimate goal being to help deliver a transformational new paradigm in computing. Solving 
          critical scientific and engineering challenges in this field requires the type of coordinated ecosystem involving
          academic institutions, national labs and industry partners, which we have created as part of SQMS. I am proud of 
          the advances our center has already demonstrated and expect many exciting new achievements in the years to come.{" "}
