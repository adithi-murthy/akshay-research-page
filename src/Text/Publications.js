export const Publication1Description = "Superconducting thin films of niobium have been extensively employed in transmon qubit architectures. Although these architectures have demonstrated improvements in recent years, further improvements in performance through materials engineering will aid in large-scale deployment. Here, we use information retrieved from secondary ion mass spectrometry and electron microscopy to conduct a detailed assessment of the surface oxide that forms in ambient conditions for transmon test qubit devices patterned from a niobium film. Our findings suggest that oxygen vacancies likely serve as a decoherence mechanism in quantum systems."

export const Publication2Description = "Superconducting qubits have emerged as a potentially foundational platform technology for addressing complex computational problems deemed intractable with classical computing. Despite recent advances enabling multiqubit designs that exhibit coherence lifetimes on the order of hundreds of Î¼s, material quality and interfacial structures continue to curb device performance. In this study we identify the presence of various impurities distributed throughout these devices. Additionally, we hypothesize the source of such impurities in these structures in an effort to intelligently fabricate superconducting qubits and extend coherence times moving forward."

export const Publication3Description = "In situ electron microscopy is an effective tool for understanding the mechanisms driving novel phenomena in 2D structures. However, due to practical challenges, it is difficult to address these technologically relevant 2D heterostructures with electron microscopy. Here, we use the differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging technique to build a methodology for probing local electrostatic fields during electrical operation with nanoscale spatial resolution in such materials. We find that, by combining a traditional DPC setup with a high-pass filter, we can largely eliminate electric fluctuations emanating from short-range atomic potentials and instead map long-range electric fields in atomically thin samples."
