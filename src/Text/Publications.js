export const Publication1Description = "We present a novel transmon qubit fabrication technique that yields 2-5x improvements in T1 coherence times. We fabricate these devices using an encapsulation strategy that involves passivating the surface of niobium and thereby preventing the formation of its lossy surface oxide. This new approach preserves fabrication and scalable manufacturability thanks to the compatibility with silicon processes. Our comparative structural and chemical analysis suggests that amorphous niobium oxides may induce higher losses compared to other amorphous oxides. "

export const Publication2Description = "Superconducting thin films of niobium have been extensively employed in transmon qubit architectures. Although these architectures have demonstrated improvements in recent years, further improvements in performance through materials engineering will aid in large-scale deployment. Here, we use information retrieved from secondary ion mass spectrometry and electron microscopy to conduct a detailed assessment of the surface oxide that forms in ambient conditions for transmon test qubit devices patterned from a niobium film. Our findings suggest that oxygen vacancies likely serve as a decoherence mechanism in quantum systems."

export const Publication3Description = "Superconducting qubits have emerged as a potentially foundational platform technology for addressing complex computational problems deemed intractable with classical computing. Despite recent advances enabling multiqubit designs that exhibit coherence lifetimes on the order of hundreds of Î¼s, material quality and interfacial structures continue to curb device performance. In this study we identify the presence of various impurities distributed throughout these devices. Additionally, we hypothesize the source of such impurities in these structures in an effort to intelligently fabricate superconducting qubits and extend coherence times moving forward."
