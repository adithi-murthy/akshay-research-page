export const Publication1Description = "Superconducting qubits have emerged as a potentially foundational platform technology for addressing complex computational problems deemed intractable with classical computing. Despite recent advances enabling multiqubit designs that exhibit coherence lifetimes on the order of hundreds of Î¼s, material quality and interfacial structures continue to curb device performance. Two-level system defects in the thin superconducting film and adjacent dielectric regions introduce stochastic noise and dissipate electromagnetic energy at the cryogenic operating temperatures. In this study, we utilize time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to understand the role specific fabrication procedures play in introducing such dissipation mechanisms in these complex systems. We interrogated Nb thin films and transmon qubit structures fabricated through slight modifications in the processing and vacuum conditions. We find that when the Nb film is sputtered onto the Si substrate, oxide and silicide regions are generated at various interfaces. We also observe that impurity species, such as niobium hydrides and carbides, are incorporated within the niobium layer during the subsequent lithographic patterning steps. The formation of these resistive compounds likely impacts the superconducting properties of the Nb thin film. Additionally, we observe the presence of halogen species distributed throughout the patterned thin films. We conclude by hypothesizing the source of such impurities in these structures in an effort to intelligently fabricate superconducting qubits and extend coherence times moving forward.Publication1 Txt: This is a wider card with supporting text below as a natural lead-into additional content.

export const Publication2Description = "In situ electron microscopy is an effective tool for understanding the mechanisms driving novel phenomena in 2D structures. However, due to practical challenges, it is difficult to address these technologically relevant 2D heterostructures with electron microscopy. Here, we use the differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging technique to build a methodology for probing local electrostatic fields during electrical operation with nanoscale spatial resolution in such materials. We find that, by combining a traditional DPC setup with a high-pass filter, we can largely eliminate electric fluctuations emanating from short-range atomic potentials. Using a method based on this filtering algorithm, a priori electric field expectations can be directly compared with experimentally derived values to readily identify inhomogeneities and potentially problematic regions. We use this platform to analyze the electric field and charge density distribution across layers of hBN and MoS2."

export const Publication3 = "Direct Visualization of Electric-Field-Induced Structural Dynamics in Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides"
export const Publication3Description = "Layered transition metal dichalcogenides offer many attractive features for next-generation low-dimensional device geometries. Due to the practical and fabrication challenges related to in situ methods, the atomistic dynamics that give rise to realizable macroscopic device properties are often unclear. In this study, in situ transmission electron microscopy techniques are utilized in order to understand the structural dynamics at play, especially at interfaces and defects, in the prototypical film of monolayer MoS2 under electrical bias. Through our sample fabrication process, we clearly identify the presence of mass transport in the presence of a lateral electric field. In particular, we observe that the voids present at grain boundaries combine to induce structural deformation. The electric field mediates a net vacancy flux from the grain boundary interior to the exposed surface edge sites that leaves molybdenum clusters in its wake. Following the initial biasing cycles, however, the mass flow is largely diminished and the resultant structure remains stable over repeated biasing. We believe insights from this work can help explain observations of nonuniform heating and preferential oxidation at grain boundary sites in these materials."
