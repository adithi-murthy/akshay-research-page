export const Publication1Description = "Superconducting thin films of niobium have been extensively employed in transmon qubit architectures. Although these architectures have demonstrated improvements in recent years, further improvements in performance through materials engineering will aid in large-scale deployment. Here, we use information retrieved from secondary ion mass spectrometry and electron microscopy to conduct a detailed assessment of the surface oxide that forms in ambient conditions for transmon test qubit devices patterned from a niobium film. We observe that this oxide exhibits a varying stoichiometry with NbO and NbO2 found closer to the niobium film/oxide interface and Nb2O5 found closer to the surface. In terms of structural analysis, we find that the Nb2O5 region is semicrystalline in nature and exhibits randomly oriented grains on the order of 1−3 nm corresponding to monoclinic N−Nb2O5 that are dispersed throughout an amorphous matrix. Using fluctuation electron microscopy, we are able to map the relative crystallinity in the Nb2O5 region with nanometer spatial resolution. Through this correlative method, we observe that the highly disordered regions are more likely to contain oxygen vacancies and exhibit weaker bonds between the niobium and oxygen atoms. Based on these findings, we expect that oxygen vacancies likely serve as a decoherence mechanism in quantum systems."

export const Publication2Description = "Superconducting qubits have emerged as a potentially foundational platform technology for addressing complex computational problems deemed intractable with classical computing. Despite recent advances enabling multiqubit designs that exhibit coherence lifetimes on the order of hundreds of μs, material quality and interfacial structures continue to curb device performance. Two-level system defects in the thin superconducting film and adjacent dielectric regions introduce stochastic noise and dissipate electromagnetic energy at the cryogenic operating temperatures. In this study, we utilize time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to understand the role specific fabrication procedures play in introducing such dissipation mechanisms in these complex systems. We interrogated Nb thin films and transmon qubit structures fabricated through slight modifications in the processing and vacuum conditions. We find that when the Nb film is sputtered onto the Si substrate, oxide and silicide regions are generated at various interfaces. We also observe that impurity species, such as niobium hydrides and carbides, are incorporated within the niobium layer during the subsequent lithographic patterning steps. The formation of these resistive compounds likely impacts the superconducting properties of the Nb thin film. Additionally, we observe the presence of halogen species distributed throughout the patterned thin films. We conclude by hypothesizing the source of such impurities in these structures in an effort to intelligently fabricate superconducting qubits and extend coherence times moving forward."

export const Publication3Description = "In situ electron microscopy is an effective tool for understanding the mechanisms driving novel phenomena in 2D structures. However, due to practical challenges, it is difficult to address these technologically relevant 2D heterostructures with electron microscopy. Here, we use the differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging technique to build a methodology for probing local electrostatic fields during electrical operation with nanoscale spatial resolution in such materials. We find that, by combining a traditional DPC setup with a high-pass filter, we can largely eliminate electric fluctuations emanating from short-range atomic potentials. Using a method based on this filtering algorithm, a priori electric field expectations can be directly compared with experimentally derived values to readily identify inhomogeneities and potentially problematic regions. We use this platform to analyze the electric field and charge density distribution across layers of hBN and MoS2."
