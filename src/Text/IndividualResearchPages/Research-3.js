    <h1>Probing Local Properties:</h1>
    <p className="individualResearchBody">
      With access to rich atomic level structural information and insights into
      the processes from which they arise, the missing piece to systematically
      improving the performance of quantum systems is understanding local
      properties. I am interested in using advanced electron microscopy and
      diffraction techniques to observe exotic phenomena and states that can be
      harnessed for storing and manipulating information. Additionally, I am
      also interested in identifying inhomogeneities that limit the prevailing
      superconductivity and lead to information loss. This involves the use of
      techniques such as differential phase contrast, Lorentz TEM, and electron
      holography at room and cryogenic temperatures.
