  "Understanding of Local Structure on Global Scale: Semiconductor electronics represent a hallmark example of materials understanding and control. Through decades of dedicated materials research focusing on the deep connections between structure, processing, properties, and performance, manufacturers are able to reliably control semiconductor materials down to the parts-per-billion chemical levels and nanometer length scales necessary to achieve stable behavior in the current generation of transistors. As device miniaturization approaches the limit of diminishing returns, quantum computing has emerged as the next frontier and a platform for potentially addressing computational problems deemed intractable with classical computing. In the case of this platform as well, the quality of the constituent materials and associated surfaces and interfaces dictates the device performance and stability. Through the use of state-of-the-art analytical electron microscopy and diffraction methods, I am interested in identifying and quantifying vacancies, grain boundaries, and topological defects in crystalline and amorphous quantum materials. Further, I apply bulk measurement techniques such as x-ray techniques, mass spectrometry techniques, vibrational spectroscopy techniques, and scanning probe microscopy techniques to obtain a comprehensive understanding of defect densities within the material.";
