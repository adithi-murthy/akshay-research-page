"The first step in engineering quantum materials with specified properties is understanding the material structure. Through the use of state-of-the-art analytical electron microscopy and diffraction methods, we aim to identify and quantify vacancies, grain boundaries, and topological defects in crystalline and amorphous quantum materials. Further, we plan to pursue bulk measurement techniques such as x-ray techniques, mass spectrometry techniques, vibrational spectroscopy techniques, and scanning probe microscopy techniques to obtain a comprehensive understanding of defect densities within the material."
