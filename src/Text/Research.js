export const ResearchIntro = "As quantum systems are highly sensitive and responsive to perturbations and disorder at the atomic-scale, it is imperative to deeply understand how material structure, processing conditions, and property/performance metrics are linked. Our group seeks to study quantum materials and devices using advanced microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to understand how the stability of quantum states are impacted by variations in the atomic and nanostructure."
