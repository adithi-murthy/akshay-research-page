"I am an Associate Scientist at Fermilab investigating superconducting resonators and transmons through the use of electron microscopy and other advanced materials characterization techniques. I previously obtained my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University. My thesis research focused on studying two-dimensional materials for next generation electronic device applications.";
export const AboutMeText2 = "As quantum systems are highly sensitive and responsive to perturbations and disorder at the atomic-scale, it is imperative to deeply understand how material structure, processing conditions, and property/performance metrics are linked. I seek to study quantum materials and devices using advanced microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to understand how the stability of quantum states are impacted by variations in the atomic and nanostructure."
