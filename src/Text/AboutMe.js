"I am an associate scientist and the group leader of the Materials for Quantum Devices group within the Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Division at Fermilab, part of the Department of Energy’s National Quantum Information Science Research Center — SQMS. The research group primarily focuses on improving the length of time information can be effectively stored and processed in a superconducting quantum device. Dramatically extending this coherence time is critical for realizing next-generation quantum computers and sensors";
